-- Update a user to be an admin (replace with your email)
-- After running this, you can manually set is_admin = true for your user in Supabase dashboard
-- OR run: UPDATE profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- This script is a template - you'll need to update it with your admin email after signup
-- Example: UPDATE profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';

-- For now, this is just a placeholder comment
-- To make yourself admin, either:
-- 1. Run this in Supabase SQL Editor: UPDATE profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
-- 2. Or we'll create an admin UI to promote users
